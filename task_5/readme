# TASK 5

1. To implement a countdown timer with step in 1 second. Initial value should be 9999. Current value of the timer should be shown on 7-segment display. Use spi to communicate with display. When time is over timer should produce a sound (~2kHz) by buzzer (since buzzer is not connected to any timer, you can use any approach to drive it: gpio, spi6_sck, etc). When you touch any button buzzer should stop to buzz. The last timer's value should be stored in eeprom (any one you like). You should be able to set timer value via usart3.
